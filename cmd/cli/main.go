Bootstraps a node which is started in pairing mode. It can send over a configuration file used to install the c3os node.

For example:
$ c3os register --config config.yaml --device /dev/sda ~/Downloads/screenshot.png

will decode the QR code from ~/Downloads/screenshot.png and bootstrap the node remotely.

If the image is omitted, a screenshot will be taken and used to decode the QR code.

See also https://docs.c3os.io/installation/device_pairing/ for documentation.

		Name:      "bridge",
		UsageText: "bridge --network-token XXX",
		Usage:     "Connect to a c3os VPN network",
		Description: `
Starts a bridge with a c3os network or a node. 

# With a network

By default, "bridge" will create a VPN network connection to the node with the token supplied, thus it requires elevated permissions in order to work.

For example:

$ sudo c3os bridge --network-token <TOKEN>

Will start a VPN, which local ip is fixed to 10.1.0.254 (tweakable with --address).

The API will also be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8080

# With a node

"c3os bridge" can be used also to connect over to a node in recovery mode. When operating in this modality c3os bridge requires no specific permissions, indeed a tunnel
will be created locally to connect to the machine remotely.

For example:

$ c3os bridge --qr-code-image /path/to/image.png

Will scan the QR code in the image and connect over. Further instructions on how to connect over will be printed out to the screen.
